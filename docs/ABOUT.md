Elm is a pure, functional language that compiles to javascript.

It was designed by Evan Czaplicki as part of writing his thesis on [Concurrent FRP for Functional GUIs](http://elm-lang.org/papers/concurrent-frp.pdf) and evolved into a language to help make making user interfaces better.

Elm's goal is to be the simplest and best language to use to make web-based user interfaces.

One of the primary goals of Elm is to completely eliminate runtime exceptions before they reach production by combining an aggressively helpful compiler with solid architectural principles.
