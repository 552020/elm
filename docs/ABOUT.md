Elm is a pure, functional language that compiles to javascript.

It was designed by Evan Czaplicki as part of writing his thesis on [Concurrent FRP for Functional GUIs](http://elm-lang.org/papers/concurrent-frp.pdf) and evolved into a language to help make making user interfaces better.

Elm's goal is to be the simplest and best language for making web-based user interfaces.

Elm aims to completely eliminate runtime exceptions by combining an aggressively helpful compiler with solid architectural principles.
